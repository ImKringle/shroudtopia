<b>This version is highly unstable as turning any of the other outdated mods on will crash the server / client.</b>

I'm excited to introduce **Shroudtopia**, a modloader that allows easy management and integration of mods for Enshrouded. With Shroudtopia, you can dynamically load, activate, and deactivate mods without restarting, giving you the ultimate flexibility to enhance gameplay.


## Modloader Features

- **Mod Management**: Dynamically load and unload mods from the "mods" folder.
- **Live Configuration**: Modify mod settings at runtime without restarting the server.
- **Dependency Injection**: Each mod is fully integrated into the system via the `ModContext`, enabling shared access to configuration, logging, and other utilities.


## Example Mods

- **Flight Mod:** Enjoy full flight capabilities with the glider. No more losing height!

- **First Person View:** Play Enshrouded from another persepctive. Example for client-only mod.

- **BasicsMod:** Flight Mod is no fun with fall damage. All other legacy Shroudtopia features have been put into this mod. You can selectively activate them in the configuration file.


## Installation

1. **Download:** Get the latest modloader binaries from the [release section](https://github.com/s0t7x/shroudtopia/releases).
2. **Setup:** Extract the files into your Enshrouded game or dedicated server folder.
3. **Mods Folder:** Create a `mods` folder if it doesnâ€™t exist and place your mod DLLs inside.
4. **Launch:** Start the game / server - a default config is generated if `shroudtopia.json` is absent.

On servers: If Shroudtopia is loaded correctly, you should see something like this in the server console:
```
[shroudtopia][INFO] Config loaded.
[shroudtopia][INFO] Wait before injection. Configured boot delay is 3000ms.
```

Upon the first launch, a default configuration file `shroudtopia.json` is created. All mods are deactivated by default, so you must manually activate them by adjusting the configuration.


## Configuration

Each mod can be enabled or customized via the `shroudtopia.json` config file. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```json
{
    "active": true,
    "bootDelay": 3000,
    "enableLogging": true,
    "logLevel": "INFO",
    "mods": {
        "basics": {
            "active": true,
            "no_stamina_loss": true,
            "no_fall_damage": true,
            "no_craft_cost": true,
            "inf_item_use": true,
            "bypass_altar_limit": true
        },
        "Flight Mod": {
            "active": true
        }
    },
    "updateDelay": 500
}
```

Each mod exposes its configuration options, which can be altered in `shroudtopia.json`. For instance, to enable or disable specific features for the basics mod:
```json
"basics": {
    "active": true,
    "no_stamina_loss": true,
    "no_fall_damage": false,
    "no_craft_cost": true,
    "inf_item_use": true,
    "bypass_altar_limit": true
}
```

# Creating Mods
Mods for Shroudtopia are written as dynamic libraries (DLLs) and need to include `shroudtopia.h` from `./shroudtopia/`.
They must implement the `Mod` interface and provide the factory function `extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) Mod* CreateModInstance()`.

Hereâ€™s an example factory function:
```cpp
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) Mod* CreateModInstance() {
    return new BasicsMod();
}
```

## Mod Interface
Every mod must implement the following functions to integrate with the modloader:
```cpp
class Mod {
public:
    virtual ~Mod() {}
    virtual ModMetaData GetMetaData() = 0;
    virtual void Load(ModContext* modContext) = 0;
    virtual void Unload(ModContext* modContext) = 0;
    virtual void Activate(ModContext* modContext) = 0;
    virtual void Deactivate(ModContext* modContext) = 0;
    virtual void Update(ModContext* modContext) = 0;
};
```

`ModMetaData` contains essential information about the mod:
```cpp
struct ModMetaData {
    std::string name;
    std::string description;
    std::string version;
    std::string author;
    std::string targetShroudtopiaVersion;
    bool hasClientSupport;
    bool hasServerSupport;
};
```

## ModContext
The `ModContext` is passed to each mod and provides access to core functionality, such as configuration, logging, and mod management. For example, the mod can retrieve config values via:
```cpp
bool enabled = modContext->config.GetBool("modName", "feature_name", false);
```


# Contributing
Currently no really game specific functions are implemented in the modContext. This is first try. Anyways, contributions are welcome! Fork the repository, add improvements, and submit pull requests. I would be happy to see more mods for this around.
